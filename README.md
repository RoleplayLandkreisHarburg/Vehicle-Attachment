# Inferno Collection: Vehicle Attachment
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/inferno-collection/Vehicle-Attachment.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/inferno-collection/Vehicle-Attachment)

__Public Beta Version 1.5__

A lightweight vehicle attachment/tow script for FiveM. Attach vehicles to other vehicles and adjust the positioning with easy to use keybinds. Multiple attachments to the same vehicles (such as a flatbed trailer) are also possible.

This resource requires at least OneSync \"legacy\". Use [Public Beta Version 1.3](https://github.com/inferno-collection/Vehicle-Attachment/releases/tag/v1.3-beta) if you do not want to use OneSync.

Presently, the following can be customized:
- Toggleable line that is drawn to show you what vehicle you are interacting with.
- Toggleable chat message instructions on how to move vehicles around.
- Attachment black/whitelist.
    - Toggleable between the two.
    - Toggleable option to have a complete whitelist, allowing control of which vehicles can and cannot be towed.
- Max number of vehicles attached to one tow vehicle
- Max distance from tow vehicles other vehicles can be attached.
- Control over how fast/slow attachment positioning is.
- Option to drive vehicles onto towing vehicle to confirm position (`/attach driveon`)

Usage:
- Go up to a vehicle and type `/attach` or `/attach driveon`
- Select the tow vehicle, and then vehicle to be towed with the `Enter` key
- Follow on screen instructions to position the vehicle
- Repeat for as many vehicles as you would like to attach
- When ready to detach, type `/detach` near a tow vehicle and vehicles will detach in the reverse order they were attached
